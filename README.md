The goal here is to predict if a picture is a cat or a dog, i.e.: two way classification also known as binary classification. This is done by training some set of pictures for both cats and dogs and validating them with another set of cats and dogs pictures. Tensorflow library is used to develop this algorithm. A convolutional neural netwoek(CNN) structure is used with three hidden layers. To improve the accuracy you can get more pictures to fit into the model some important modules and libraries to install be able to run the codes using this algorithm are listed below

-Tensorflow

-Theano

-Matplotlib

-Pandas

-numpy

-cv2

-Keras

-Scipy
